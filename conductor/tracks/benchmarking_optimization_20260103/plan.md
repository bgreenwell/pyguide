# Plan: Benchmarking & Optimization

## Phase 1: Feature Completeness
- [ ] Task: Implement `cost_complexity_pruning_path` for Classifier and Regressor
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Feature Completeness' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Benchmark Suite
- [ ] Task: Create `benchmarks/` directory and `main_benchmark.py`
- [ ] Task: Implement comparison logic (GUIDE vs CART) on standard datasets
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Benchmark Suite' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Profiling & Optimization
- [ ] Task: Profile the benchmark run to identify hotspots
- [ ] Task: Apply optimizations to the identified hotspots
- [ ] Task: Re-run benchmarks to verify speedup
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Profiling & Optimization' (Protocol in workflow.md)
