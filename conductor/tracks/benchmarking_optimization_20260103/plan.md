# Plan: Benchmarking & Optimization

## Phase 1: Feature Completeness [checkpoint: 897c5d7]
- [x] Task: Implement `cost_complexity_pruning_path` for Classifier and Regressor [cc1a2b3]
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Feature Completeness' (Protocol in workflow.md) [897c5d7]

## Phase 2: Benchmark Suite
- [x] Task: Create `benchmarks/` directory and `main_benchmark.py` [cc1a2b3]
- [x] Task: Implement comparison logic (GUIDE vs CART) on standard datasets [cc1a2b3]
- [~] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Benchmark Suite' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Profiling & Optimization
- [ ] Task: Profile the benchmark run to identify hotspots
- [ ] Task: Apply optimizations to the identified hotspots
- [ ] Task: Re-run benchmarks to verify speedup
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Profiling & Optimization' (Protocol in workflow.md)
